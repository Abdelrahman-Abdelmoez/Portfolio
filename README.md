## Website

[ACRV158.**github.io**/Portfolio](https://acrv158.github.io/Portfolio/)

## Todo

### Urgent

- [ ] Make the Page more responsive.
  - [ ] **Responsive text**: Add CSS property `font-size: clamp(min, ideal, max);` to all text including `h1, p, a` and others[^1].
  - [ ] Test `work-item` class with `flexbox` instead of `grid` to be responsive. (Also add `flex Grow` and `flow row`).
  - [ ] You could make the whole page `flex` with main sections as `flex items` to be centered and take as much width as possible.

- [ ] Add projects/ portfolio.

- [ ] Change contact list style in footer.
  - [ ] remove bullets and use flexbox to better align the layout.

- [ ] Style
